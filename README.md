# Nick Smith Portfolio

## Description

I created this website to be a central hosting repository to showcase the various coding projects I have completed. Future employers may learn about me by visiting this site. 

This project features a portfolio website built from scratch highlighting Nick Smith. I created it using HTML and CSS. It contains live links that jump to the selected section of the webpage, hover effects, and responsiveness. I learned about the usefulness of planning out the webpage layout prior to coding and the usefulness of flexbox.
